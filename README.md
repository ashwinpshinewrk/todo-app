# Todo-App

A simple Todo-app made with svelte to learn the framework

## Using

Once you've created a project and open the file

```bash
npm install
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
